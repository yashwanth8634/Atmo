🌦️ Atmo Weather
Tired of boring weather apps? Atmo is a clean, modern weather dashboard that does more than just show the temperature. It gives you smart advice, remembers your favorite spots, and looks great doing it—all built with pure, vanilla JavaScript.

What's Inside?
This isn't just another weather app. Here's what makes Atmo special:

⚡ Smart Geolocation: The app automatically finds your location on page load for instant, relevant weather. No typing needed on the first visit.

✍️ Live Search Suggestions: As you type, a list of city suggestions appears in real-time to prevent typos and find places faster.

🧠 Lifestyle Forecaster: Goes beyond the data to give simple advice, like if it's a good time for a walk or if you should grab an umbrella.

📅 Detailed Forecasts: See a full 24-hour hourly breakdown and a 5-day summary to plan your week ahead.

🎨 Dynamic UI: The entire app theme and background color change to match the current weather—from sunny blue skies to moody rain clouds.

🔖 Save Your Favorites: Click the bookmark icon to save your favorite cities. The app remembers them for next time using localStorage. The bookmark even toggles between adding and removing!

⇄ Unit Conversion: A simple toggle lets you switch all temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and your choice is saved.

🌍 Live World Clock: See your local time and the searched city's time side-by-side, updating every second. It even shows the timezone names (like IST) and has a toggle to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

The Tech Stack
No frameworks, no libraries. Just the fundamentals, done right.

HTML5

CSS3 (with Flexbox, Grid, and Animations)

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules, async/await, localStorage, Geolocation API)

Behind the Code
Building Atmo was a deep dive into creating a feature-rich application from scratch. The main challenge was managing all the different states—the current city, the user's saved favorites, and the selected temperature unit—and making sure the UI reacted instantly to any change.

I learned how to handle chained API requests, process complex data into a simple format (like the 5-day forecast), and optimize performance with techniques like debouncing on the search input. It's proof that you can build something powerful and polished with just the core tools of the web.
